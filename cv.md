.map((group) => group.items
  .filter((item) => 'id' in item)
  .map((item) => item.id))
.flat();

id = [...new Set(id)];

if (id.length > 0) {
const productResponse = await api.get('product.php', { params: { id } });
const products = productResponse.data.reduce(
  /**
    * @param {Object} acc

    *   ID: string,
    *   NAME: string,
    *   TEXT: string,
    *   URL: string,

    */
  (acc, item) => {
    acc[item.ID] = {
      name: item.NAME,
